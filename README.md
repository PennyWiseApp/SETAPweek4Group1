# Pre-Script

We are doing the scenario for **"pre-script"**

## Below will be the questions we ask

1. ### Do you expect the application to act as a means of ordering a prescription or simply notifying a user that they should renew?

> The user wants it to do both

3. ### Do you expect the app to provide the locations/directions to nearby pharmacies where the user can pick up the prescription?

> No, I'd rather have the app provide details of my preferred pharmacy. The app will send the parties to the preferred GP, and then the GP will send the prescription to the pharmacy; if the pharmacy doesn't have the medication, the application will notify the user of the pharmacy change to a different one.

3. ### What data do you expect the app to store?

> personal identifying info, NHS number, name, dob, medication on, preferred pharmacy, and GP

4. ### What are the most essential features of the application?

> Top priorities are to automatically generate prescriptions when I am close to running out, automatically send the request to the pharmacy/GP, notify the user of the medication being ready

5. ### What do the current users use to keep track of prescriptions before the app is developed?

> User stated, currently the process of prescription admin is chaotic due to an insuffecient method of organisation. It takes at least a week per prescription. The calendar app is used to set the date and times for prescription ordering, pick ups and renewals. The user also needs to remember to set the dates for future meds, which is a hassle and wishes this whole process to be automated by just putting in the information once.

6. ### What is your preferred method of being notified?

> How would the user like to be updated about the status? The user wants to be updated about the quality of the medication, explaining if the prescription cannot be filled.

## So what are the system requirements?

 1. Automatic Ordering of prescriptions
 2. Automatic tracking of prescriptions
 3. Automatic updates to prescription status
